# üéì LearnMate - Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways

**IBM AI & Cloud Internship Final Project**  
*Conducted by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with IBM SkillBuild and AICTE*

---

## üìã Project Overview

LearnMate is an **Agentic AI coach** that revolutionizes personalized learning by creating dynamic, adaptive course pathways tailored to individual students' interests, skill levels, and career goals. Unlike traditional course recommendation systems, LearnMate acts as an intelligent mentor that continuously adapts learning paths based on student progress and feedback.

### üéØ Problem Statement

Students often struggle to identify the right learning path that aligns with their interests and long-term goals due to:
- Overwhelming number of online courses available
- Lack of personalized guidance
- Static learning paths that don't adapt to progress
- Difficulty in skill level assessment
- No clear progression from beginner to expert

### üí° Solution

LearnMate solves these challenges by:
- **Conversational AI Interface**: Natural language interaction for understanding student needs
- **Intelligent Skill Assessment**: Dynamic evaluation of current capabilities
- **Adaptive Pathways**: Learning routes that evolve based on progress and feedback
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Coverage across 10+ technology domains
- **Progress Tracking**: Continuous monitoring and pathway optimization
